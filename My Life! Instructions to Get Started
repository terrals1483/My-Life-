Welcome to "My Life!" To get started, please select your avatar's name and sex. (Female = 1; Male = 2) (Name: Sally = 3; Sam = 4) 
Once you have selected your avatar's name and sex, you will then proceed to the first stage of the lifespan, infancy. You will complete a series of activites informed by the physcial, social and cogvitive development seen during the infancy stage; be sure to have read your textbook! 
After completing the infancy stage you will be quizzed on the stage before you will be able to unlock the next staage of the lifespan, early childhood. 
Remember, all of your progress will be saved within this interface and your quiz scores will be reported in our Canvas course.
